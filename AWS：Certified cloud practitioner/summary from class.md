**1.What is Cloud Computing and Services?In your own words, what do you think Cloud computing is? and its associated services?**  
Cloud computing refers to the use of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data, instead of using a local server or a personal computer. These services include data storage, servers, databases, networking, software, analytics, artificial intelligence.  
  
**2.What's the different between Public, Private cloud and Hybrid? State the differences between these types** 
Public cloud means everything built on the cloud.  
Private cloud means everything built on company’s data centers also known as on-Premise.  
Hybrid means using both on-Premise and a cloud service, like you have a connection between your on-premise environment and public cloud.  
  
**3.What's the benefit of the cloud?**
Agility, Pay as you go pricing, Economy of scale, Global Reach, Security, Reliability, High Availability, Scalability, Elasticity, Fault Tolerance, Disaster Recovery  
  
**4.What is AWS Infrastructure? Explain?**
The AWS Global Infrastructure is globally distributed hardware and data centers that are physically networked together to act as one large resource for the end customer. The Global Infrastructure include:  
a.Regions: geographically distinct locations. Every region is physically isolated from every other region in terms of location, power, water supply. If the power goes out, it is not going to affect the other regions.  
b.Availability Zones: the physical location made up of one or more datacenter. AZs is one or more physical isolated data centers in AWS regions. Generally a region consist of three availability zones.  
c.Fault Tolerance: the ability of a system—whether it's hardware, software, or a network—to continue operating properly even if part of the system fails. It ensures high availability, reliability, and continuous service, even in the event of hardware or software malfunctions.  
d. Point of Presence: a connection between AWS region and the end user for content caching and fast transfer. It include Edge Locations and Regional Edge Caches / Locations. Edge Locations cache the most frequently visited content. Regional Edge Caches / Locations caches are not very popular but still have access needs.  
e. Local Zones: data centers located very close to a densely populated area.  
f. Wavelength Zones: mainly for edge computing, associated to 5G networks. Applications will have ultra-low latency being as close as possible to the users.  
f. Data Residency: The enterprise's data must be stored in a specific geographical location or country to meet data compliance and control.    
g. Sustainability: include renewable energy, cloud efficiency, water stewardship.   
h. AWS Ground Station: a fully managed ground station service.  
i. AWS Outposts: a fully managed service that offers the same AWS infrastructure and AWS Services APIs tools. So on and so forth. That is similar to their Cloud portal, but instead, instead of AWS, hosting the hardware and managing all of that. They will send you the rack with the servers in it, and then you manage your data and everything from the AWS portal while having and maintaining the actual. Hardware from AWS within your data center.  
  
**5.What are the differences between Regional and Global?**
Regional only have certain permissions in a specific region.  
Global means no regional restrictions  
  
**6.What is the AWS Availability Zone?**
The physical location made up of one or more datacenter.  
AZs is one or more physical isolated data centers in AWS regions. Generally a region consist of three availability zones.
